# TOMbot
Look, we all share a favorite pasttime of finding a good musicbot for our podcast live recording sessions, but eventually you have to accept that the destination really is better than the journey. This is a podcast helper bot that can play music, host games for listeners, and generally be a fun guy. It's easy to work with, but you'll have to adapt it to your own uses unless you share inside jokes with The Orbital Mechanics. [Let me know](mailto:ben@theorbitalmechanics) if you come up with something cool!
